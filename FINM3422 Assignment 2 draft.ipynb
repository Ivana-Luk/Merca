    "The double moving average strategy is a trading approach employing two moving averages based on a security's price - a short-term and a long-term one. It operates by identifying potential buy and sell signals. A buy signal occurs when the short-term moving average surpasses the long-term moving average, signifying an upward momentum. Conversely, a sell signal emerges when the short-term moving average falls below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downturn. This strategy capitalizes on the premise that short-term price shifts are often erratic, while long-term price trends display more predictable behavior. The primary objective is to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in prices, aiming to benefit from these distinct market movements."
